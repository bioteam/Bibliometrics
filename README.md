The DCC's funded by CFDE create numerous datasets used and cited throughout the scientific community. We will refer to papers written "about" the DCC and cited in subsequent works as "Flagship Publications". To identify each DCC's flagship publications, we...
DESCRIBE METHODS SAM USED TO IDENTIFY FLAGSHIP PAPERS

Publications resulting from datasets produced by DCCs are more difficult to track. In the easy case, they may cite the dataset or flagship paper, allowing us to efficiently credit the DCC for the publication. However, some may simply Acknowledge the DCC dataset or producing researcher, and sometimes the data set name can only be found as a keyword search, making complete tracking difficult. We used the following methods to build a comprehensive list of papers mentioned in each program:

METHODS FOR TRACKING PAPERS

# Methods

## Gathering CFDE Citations and Publications

### Using the CFDE website

We gathered publications for a selection of target DCCs using the Common Fund [Publications Search by Program website](https://commonfund.nih.gov/publications?pid=0). We wrote a web scraping program to gather all the publications listed for the target programs, then used the [PubMed API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/#_chapter4_EFetch_) and the [OpenAlex API](http://openalex.org/) to gather bibliometric data and save the results. 

### Using iCite

Note iCite has an API: https://icite.od.nih.gov/api
